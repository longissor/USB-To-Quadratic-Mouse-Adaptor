## This USB mouse adaptor also work with some USB Joypad.

But not al Joypad are compatible. Only Joypad with a "Standard" mapping and no analog axies may work.
It is not easy to know which Joypad may work and which one will not before buying them and testing them.

The following will help you to decide if the joypad will work on this USD adaptor:

- Go to https://hardwaretester.com/gamepad
- Plug you Joypad and press a boutton.
- Check the following:
 - STANDARD GAMEPAD should show in the name just before the vendor
 - below the name of the Joypad, there should only be grey dots, no grey dashes.
 - mapping should be Standard and not n/a
 - There should only be bouttons B1, B2, B3,...Bx
 - There should not be analog axies like AXIS 0 and AXIS 1

Here are what you should look at.


Of course, even if these all check out, thee is always a risk the Joypad may not work. Remember, we are connecting modern, often off brand devices to 30+ years old computers.
